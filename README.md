# Collectomundo

## What is it?

Collectomundo is an app that allows a retro game collector (like myself) to keep track of the games they currently own and what they are currently looking for.  The application does this through the use of three tabs.  One for searching for games (powered by Giant Bomb's game database and API), one for viewing and managing one's collection, and one for viewing and managing one's wishlist (and hopefully promoting some of the items to their collection).  Also, if more information is desired on a particular game, you need only click on the game to be sent to the appropriate detail page on Giant Bomb.  All views have their games sorted by system to make your search easier.

## How to use it?

Search for games in "Discover" tab.  Then when you find a game you are interested in, tap on the game to open the details page on the Giant Bomb site, or if you want to add it to your collection or wishlist swipe it to the left and select "Collect" or "Wishlist".  You can then go into the Collection or Wishlist tabs to view the respective lists.  On Wishlist you have the option to promote the wishlist item to your collection by swiping left and selecting "Collect".  On both lists you may also remove them from the list.  Lastly you can also perform the same updates from the discover list when a search reveals a game you already have in either list.

## Future Releases

In future releases (even after the Udacity project), I plan to add:

* Searches for accessories and consoles.
* Firebase collection storage and sharing of collections and wishlists.
* A web app that will allow you to share your collection and wishlists with people who don't use Collectomundo.
* The ability to mark on a map (using a pin or your current location) a game you have found.  Users with that item in their wishlist will be notified.
