# Collectomundo

## What is it?

Collectomundo is an app that allows a retro game collector (like myself) to keep track of the games they currently own and what they are currently looking for.  The application does this through the use of three tabs.  One for searching for games (powered by Giant Bomb's game database and API), one for viewing and managing one's collection, and one for viewing and managing one's wishlist (and hopefully promoting some of the items to their collection).  Also, if more information is desired on a particular game, you need only click on the game to be sent to the appropriate detail page on Giant Bomb.  All views have their games sorted by system to make your search easier.

## Future Releases

In future releases (even after the Udacity project), I plan to add:

* Searches for accessories and consoles.
* Firebase collection storage and sharing of collections and wishlists.
* A web app that will allow you to share your collection and wishlists with people who don't use Collectomundo.
* The ability to mark on a map (using a pin or your current location) a game you have found.  Users with that item in their wishlist will be notified.
